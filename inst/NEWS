VERSION 1.0.0
-------------

Initial release of package BLMA includes:

* BilevelAnalysisGeneset: a function to perform a bi-level meta-analysis in conjunction with geneset enrichment methods (ORA/GSA/PADOG) to integrate multiple gene expression datasets.

* BilevelAnalysisPathway: a function to perform a bi-level meta-analysis conjunction with Impact Analysis to integrate multiple gene expression datasets.

* IntraAnalysisClassic: a function to perform an intra-experiment analysis in conjunction with any of the classical hypothesis testing methods, such as t-test, Wilcoxon test, etc.

* BilevelAnalysisClassic: a function to perform a bi-level meta-analysis in conjunction with any of the classical hypothesis testing methods, such as t-test, Wilcoxon test, etc.

* IntraAnalysisGene: a function to perform an intra-experiment analysis in conjunction with the moderated t-test (limma package) for the purpose of differential expression analysis of a gene expression dataset
